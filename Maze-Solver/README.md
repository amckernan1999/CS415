Summary: This project reads in a maze.bmp and calculates the shortest path between two points. There are two algorithms
used here. Breadth First search is a normal shortest path alg similar to djikstras, Best First Search leverages          
a priority queue with priority of anticipated distance to destination that allows it to visit less nodes than BFS
